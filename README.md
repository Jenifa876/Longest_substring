##Maximum Length Substring Problem
**Overview**
This C++ program calculates the maximum length of a substring that can contain at most k characters that are different from the most frequent character in that substring. It utilizes the sliding window technique along with a hash map to keep track of character frequencies.

**Features**
Prompts the user to enter a string and an integer k.
Computes the maximum length of a substring where the difference between the total length and the frequency of the most common character does not exceed k.

**Explanation of the Code**
Input Handling: The program takes a string s and an integer k from the user.
Data Structures: An unordered map (hash) is used to track the frequency of each character in the current window.
Sliding Window Technique:
A left pointer l and a right pointer r define the current substring.
As the right pointer expands the window, the frequency of the character at r is updated.
If the number of characters that need to be replaced exceeds k, the left pointer is moved to reduce the window size.
Output: Finally, it prints the maximum length of the valid substring
